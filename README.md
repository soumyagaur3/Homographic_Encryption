Homomorphic Encryption (HE) is a groundbreaking cryptographic technique that allows computations to be performed on encrypted data without the need for decryption, thereby preserving data confidentiality while enabling efficient processing. Introduced in 2009, HE has the ability to reconcile data security and computational efficiency, offering immense potential for secure cloud computing, data privacy, and outsourcing computations across fields such as healthcare and finance, where sensitive data processing is of utmost importance. This academic project aims to further advance the theory and implementation of HE schemes, with the goal of harnessing their full potential in resolving the seemingly contradictory objectives of ensuring data security and facilitating data utilization. By exploring and refining HE techniques, this research endeavors to unlock new avenues for secure data processing, enabling organizations to leverage the power of cloud computing and outsourced computations while maintaining the highest standards of data privacy and confidentiality.
